##WELCOME TO
###the code for Welcome To, an automated conference talk

slideshare.py is the main script, which handles all of the webdriving and theatrical timing

custom\_markov.py is the module where all the markov model functions got moved after refactoring

gdocs\_api\_calls.py is the module where all the google slide api functions got moved after refactoring

text\_corpuses is where the starting corpus text lives (none of the scraped text used in markov generation is saved... for reasons...)

test\_scripts are some sloppy debugging tools
