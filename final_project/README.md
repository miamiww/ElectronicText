## WELCOME TO
### the code for Welcome To, an automated conference talk

_slideshare.py_ is the main script, which handles all of the webdriving and theatrical timing

_custom\_markov.py_ is the module where all the markov model functions got moved after refactoring

_gdocs\_api\_calls.py_ is the module where all the google slide api functions got moved after refactoring

_text\_corpuses_ is where the starting corpus text lives (none of the scraped text used in markov generation is saved... for reasons...)

_test\_scripts_ are some sloppy debugging tools
